Calculating the coherence between two channels
##############################################

The `coherence <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)>`_ between
two channels is a measure of the frequency-domain correlation between their
time-series data.

In LIGO, the coherence is a crucial indicator of how noise sources couple into
the main differential arm-length readout.

In this example we calculate the coherence between two length-sensing
degrees of freedom, the Signal-Recycling Cavity length (SRCL), and the
Common-Arm motion (CARM).




First, we import the `TimeSeriesDict`

.. code-block:: python

   from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeriesDict


and then :meth:`~TimeSeriesDict.get` both data sets:

.. code-block:: python

   data = TimeSeriesDict.get(['L1:LSC-SRCL_IN1_DQ', 'L1:LSC-CARM_IN1_DQ'],
                              'Feb 13 2015', 'Feb 13 2015 00:15')


We can then calculate the :meth:`~TimeSeries.coherence` of one
`TimeSeries` with respect to the other, using an 8-second Fourier
transform length, with a 4-second (50%) overlap:

.. code-block:: python

   coh = data['L1:LSC-SRCL_IN1_DQ'].coherence(data['L1:LSC-CARM_IN1_DQ'], 8, 4)


Finally, we can :meth:`~gwpy.spectrum.Spectrum.plot` the resulting data:

.. code-block:: python

   plot = coh.plot(figsize=[12, 6], label=None)
   ax = plot.gca()
   ax.set_yscale('linear')
   ax.set_xlabel('Frequency [Hz]')
   ax.set_ylabel('Coherence')
   ax.set_title('Coherence between SRCL and CARM for L1')
   ax.grid(True, 'both', 'both')
   plot.show()

.. plot:: ../examples/spectrum/coherence.py
